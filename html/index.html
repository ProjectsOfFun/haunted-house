      <p><em>Haunted House</em> began life as the example program from the book <a href="https://archive.org/details/Write_your_own_Adventure_Programs/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Write your own Adventure Programs for your Microcomputer</em></a> by Jenny Tyler and Les Howarth (&copy;1983 Usborne Publishing). Much of what I know about programming on the Apple ][ came from that book.</p>
      <p>Several years ago, as programming exercise, I decided to port <em>Haunted House</em> into JavaScript. This rudimentary version of the game is <a href="v1.50/">posted on this site</a>. Writing the port, I released that I could leverage what I had learned to make a more robust (and fair) version of the game. <em><a href="haunted-house.html">Haunted House: Remastered</a></em> is the result of that effort.</p>
      <p>The remastered version features full room descriptions, story events, a slick retro-styled interface, sound effects, thrills, chills, and puzzles that sorta make sense! So, if you are ready for some intense text adventuring, <a href="haunted-house.html">start the game</a> already!</p>
      <p>A note: I try to keep everything fair, but there are a couple of ways in which you can die. You usually will get a few warning messages beforehand, so don't be afraid to experiment.</p>
      <P>I'll probably regret this, but if you find any bugs or egregious typos, let me know.
